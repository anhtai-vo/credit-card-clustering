Using the k-means clustering method in machine learning to divide customers into clusters based on similar behaviors.
In this project, I use the file 'CC GENERAL.csv' source from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata).
Because this file was built in R markdown, so when I upload it into Github do not show the results of each line of code.
